# Semantic Interface Translation

A pattern-based approach to computer interfaces that reduces translation layers by treating interface interactions as semantic patterns rather than discrete coordinate values.

## Overview

Traditional computer interfaces process user interactions through multiple layers of translation, from physical input to system actions. This project introduces a novel pattern-based approach that reduces these translation layers by working with semantic zones and patterns instead of raw coordinates.

### Key Features

- **Contextual Zone Processing**: Replaces exact coordinates with semantic zones
- **Pattern-Based Translation**: Direct mapping from user actions to system responses
- **Reduced Processing Overhead**: Fewer translation steps between input and action
- **Context-Aware Processing**: System maintains awareness of application state and available actions

## Project Status

Currently in Phase 2: Real-World Simulation
- âœ“ Phase 1: Basic Concept Validation (Completed)
  - Initial browser-based testing environment
  - Basic zone-based semantic processing
  - Performance improvement validation (96.1% improvement observed)
- ðŸš§ Phase 2: Real-World Simulation (In Progress)
  - Implementing complex interface scenarios
  - Testing realistic UI patterns
  - Gathering comprehensive performance data
